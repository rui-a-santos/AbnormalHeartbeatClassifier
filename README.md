# Abnormal Heartbeat Classifier Project 

Authors: Rui , Matt , Louis. 

All information about the project can be seen on the ProjectDescription.pdf file.

This project is intented to run in online google colab. The code is sectioned to make it easier to navigate. 

The dataset is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/shayanfazeli/heartbeat and uploaded to google colab as 'heartbeat.zip'. 

In order to run each model with different datasets, you will need to change the X_input variables before training each model.

In order to recreate the training process use seed(1). Datasets need to prepared before training and this may involve a non-linear running of the colab code snippets for some cases in transfer-learning and NR+IN runs.
